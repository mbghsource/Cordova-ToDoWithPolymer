### Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: How to Create a To-Do List App With Polymer and Cordova

#### Instructor: Hathibelagal Ashraff

If you've been tasked with developing an Android app on a very short deadline, then using hybrid technologies might be the best thing to do. Though hybrid apps are generally slower than their native counterparts, on most modern devices users won't be able to tell the difference as long as you manage to provide the same look and feel. In this tutorial, I will be showing you how to develop a hybrid to-do list app for Android that largely conforms to Google's material design specification. We'll use Polymer, Polymer paper elements, and Apache Cordova to get the job done.
